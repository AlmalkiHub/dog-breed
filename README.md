End-to-end Multi-class classification
This project builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow library and TensorFlow Hub.

1. Problem Definition
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

When I'm sitting at the park of my neighbourhood and I take a photo of a dog, I want to know what breed of dog it is.

2. Dataset
The dataset I'm using is from Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification competition.

You can find the data through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

3. Aim of the Project
The goal is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

4. Features
Dataset information:

There are various dog images in the train and test sets (unstructured data). I will use deep learning model to classify each dog breed in a given image.

There are 120 breeds of dogs (labels).

Training set: around 10,000+ images with labels.

Test set: around 10,000+ images without labels and needs predicting its class label.
